# 📊 FinanceFlow

**FinanceFlow** is a secure, layered, and community-powered expense tracking application developed with **ASP.NET Core Web API** and **Blazor Server**. It is designed for both **individuals** and **corporate users** to manage their financial activities in a smart and structured way.

## 🌍 Community-Driven Finance

One of the core features of FinanceFlow is its **community-based expense sharing system**. Users can choose to **share selected expenses anonymously with the community**, fostering transparency, comparison, and collective financial awareness.

At the start of every month, the shared expenses are **automatically reset**, while previous data is archived. This allows the community to explore monthly trends and behaviors without revealing user identities.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Insights

FinanceFlow integrates with **AI services** to provide **natural-language financial insights** based on users' income and expense data. Using real-time prompts, the system analyzes:

- Spending patterns by category
- Opportunities for saving
- Unusual trends compared to previous months

The AI responds in a **human-like**, friendly tone to help users understand their financial habits better and make smarter decisions.
